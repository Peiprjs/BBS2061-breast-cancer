# BBS2061 - 2A - Topic A (Network Biology) 

For the course BBS2061, we were instructed to modify/create a code and run a set of computational analyses, in order to answer a set research question. 
The project involved groups of 3-4 people, which were given a certain topic regarding the course information/content. 
This respective project involves 4 individuals; Roca Cugat M.(i6351071) ; Sapsai I.(i6355626) ; Rijk IR.(i6342444) ; Mirensky Roffe DS.(i6323580).
The focus/topic of the group is the Topic A (Network Biology) - Instructions and data. 

#Based on the given instructions, and the dataset [], a reaserch question was established, which can be found on the line 10. 

Research Question (RQ): How is the G1 to S Cell Cycle Altered in Stage IA Breast Cancer Cells, Specifically Cyclins and its Inhibitors Involved?

A data set containing the differential gene expression data which compares the breast cancer and the healthy breast tissue was provided. 
It is a publicly available data set, comprised of 20, 60-75 years old, containing stage IA Breast Cancer female patients RNA sequencing data from a TCGA breast cancer project.
After careful analysis of the data, Wikipathways was utilized to differentiate and to find a specific pathway that related highly to the provided data. 
The chosen pathways (provided/explained in the written report) focused on the cell cyle, CDK and cyclin inhibitors which mainly focused on modulating CDK4/6 responses. 
The cell cycle pathways were chosen due to their important role in the tumor growth/proliferation, which peaked the interest of the respective group memnbers. 
Previously aquired knowledge led to the foundation of a possible hypotehsis, which can be found in the line 19. 

Hypothesis: The Cylcin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 Inhibtors will be Downregulated.
